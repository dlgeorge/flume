==== GateRelease1 application =================================================


1. Install digclaw4.x as a full clawpack installation. See clawpack documentation for version 4.x.

    should be relatively straightforward as long as $CLAW environment variable is set to the toplevel clawpack directory that includes geoclaw (and includes the D-claw that comes with digclaw4.x).

2. To run code:

    python makeaux.py
    python maketopo.py

    ---it is not necessary to run makedtopo.py (and it takes a long time to run)

    make new     (compile for the first time...to get modules)
    make .output (will compile and run the code).

3. To compare with flume data
      from gaugeplotting/

      python makegaugeplots.py will plot results at locations in the flume.

          note symlinks for files in case of problems

    for help: email dgeorge@usgs.gov
              see clawpack documentation for version 4.x
              see included pdf for background information about the flume experiments

4. To visualize results other than gauge comparisons:

    make .plots will make some matplotlib plots.

        above might have some module dependencies ...might be a bit glitchy at first.

    matlab can be run from the _output directory.
        make sure  this directory's ./matlab and $CLAW/matlabgeo and  $CLAW/matlab are on your path.
